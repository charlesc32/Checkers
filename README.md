Checkers
========
Problem: Build a working Checkers Lite Application 
Write an application that can play a legal game of Checkers Lite.  
It is the same as American Checkers (also known as English draughts) except there is no promotion to king 
by moving a piece to the last rank, therefore a stalemate is possible.  
Pieces move along diagonals, jumps must be taken and the board is 8x8.

The computer can make legal moves (random legal moves are acceptable for the "AI").  
The human player is not allowed to make illegal moves.  Your program should show the game board after each move.  
If there are no legal moves or one side is eliminated then inform the user the game is over.  
The suggested board output format is ASCII, use a dot (.) for empty squares, X for black and O for white.  
The initial board layout would look like this: 

      . X . X . X . X   
      X . X . X . X .   
      . X . X . X . X   
      . . . . . . . .   
      . . . . . . . .   
      O . O . O . O .   
      . O . O . O . O   
      O . O . O . O .
